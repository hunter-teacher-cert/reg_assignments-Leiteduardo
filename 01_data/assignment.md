# Intro CS- 9th Grade
## Motivation- in Football circles, it has been said time and again that Offences win games, but Defenses win championships. That means that a team that regularly scores a lot of points may go very far during the season, â€“ outscoring their opponents. However, teams with solid defenses will beat them in the playoffs. When you come to think of it, this is a puzzling proposition. You would think: how can a high scoring team not prevail over one that is focused not on scoring, but on defending?
## Task- using a Football data set, prove that the popular saying is right: yes, great defenses win Championships; or wrong, great defenses can be overwhelmed by a high scoring team.
## Procedure- 
### 1- Find a data source:
#### NFL.com- acceptable
#### ESPN- acceptable
#### Search engine
#### https://www.pro-football-reference.com/- recommended
### 2- Search for the top 10 teams with the best offenses in NFL History
### 3- Search for the top 10 teams with the best defenses in NFL History
### 4- List how many of the top 10 offenses won Super Bowls
### 5- List how many of the top 10 defenses won Super Bowls
### 6- Summarize your findings- can you say that the data proved the hypothesis or not? Explain your answer. 
### 7- Notice any factors that in your opinion might have affected the outcomes of championship games: homefield, MVP, Brady, luck(?), Brady, weather, refereeing, etc, Brady(?).

## Requirements:
#### 1- Create a list of the 10 best defenses in Football
#### 2- Create a list of the 10 best offenses in Football
#### 3- Drawing from the data, which category, best defense or best offense, has led to more Super Bowl winners?
#### 5- Name your source- the dataset you chose
##### Note: this is phase one of a larger project that will use this data in a Snap project using lists.
