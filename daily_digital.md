## Current Tech News
##### Women in Computer Science: Getting Involved in STEM
March 1, 2022 | 
ComputerScience.org Staff

##### Major points
* the history of women in CS from the rejected and defiled Ada Lovelace who wrote the first program to the present
* the article recounts the ups and downs of female participation- in 1970, women only accounted for 13.6% of bachelor's in computer science graduates
* the number grew to 37% in 1984 only to plunmet again to a current 18%

#### Why I chose this article
* because it speakes to the unpeakable lack of female participation in CS
* it calls for serious debate on why there are so many Gilrs Who (**don't**) Code
* it also calls for real action to bring girls into CS
* my best coders in the 9th grade are females(one non-binary), but only two of them have identified CS as a career
* I think that too much money is been spent by men in positions of power only to make themselves look good- they are drinking too much of their own Cool-Aid
* I have so much respect for my female classmates at Hunter and think that they are great role models wherever they teach
#### Furthere resources
* towardsdatascience.com
* https://momentum.gseis.ucla.edu/press/- New initiative aims to accelerate equity in computing and technology fields
* GALE ONEFILE-Computer Science- this site can only be reached with a library account, which we have at my school
