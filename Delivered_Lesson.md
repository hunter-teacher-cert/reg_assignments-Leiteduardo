### Group Feedback
- From the start, our group decided that the focus for our classes would be functions.We debated about how to deliver content about the topic to our 
##### different classes comprised of students at different grades.BEnson teaches MIddle School, I teach Intro CS to 9th graders, and Daina, Eric, and Mamudu 
##### teach AP SC Principles. So it took a little effort for us to align our thinking.I started with the idea to do a class that I had already taught, 
##### but Benson clarified that the class to be taught should be a new class. So I looked at how I would teach a lesson on functions to draw shapes. 
##### I started by establishing a connection between Snap and Python, but my teammates were not clear about how I would use Snap. So I explained to 
##### them that a custom block in Snap is a type of function. The groupâ€™s feedback was important in helping me to use prior knowledge as an entry point 
##### to the new topic. They questioned me how I would go from one to the other and what I wanted the students to get from the connection. 
##### How would the students benefit from the association between Snap and Python?
##### At times, explaining the Snap part to my group gave an outside perspective. At times as a teacher you experience a disconnect between what you are 
##### saying and what the students hear you saying. My group helped me to identify the blind spots in my lesson.
