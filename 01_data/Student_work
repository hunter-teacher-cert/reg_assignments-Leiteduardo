Hypothesis- Offenses win games; defenses win Championships
Who won the Superbowl in each of the years above based on data for the best
offenses/defenses fof all time.
The assumption that guides this statistical analysis is that the year in 
which a team had the best offense/defense should lead to their winning 
the Super Bowl.
