#### Joe Feldman's sentiment is that we are still grading according to a model that was created during the Industrial Revolution, whose final goal was to sort among the dominant, white culture of the time. Society needed a model to place white men into different categories, so the type of grading that was created met that requirement. But "traditional grading undermines good teaching and learning and hurts equity". That sort of grading now does not meet equity needs because it places sorting over learning. I agree with Feldman's views mainly because there are too many factors that may affect a student's grade; socio-economic status, access to needed resources, family structure, etc. Feldman also believes that we don't spend enough time building a classroom culture that would foster success, but waste too much effort using grades punitivelly. I also agree with that and I regularly check myself before deducting points from a student solely due to factors that go beyond subject mastery.

#### Something that I might not agree with totally is the idea that a student's grade should only reflect their subject mastery and exclude qualitative data such as behavior, effort, punctuality, etc. Teachers do not teach their subjects only, rather they must also show the students a path towards success which includes the social and emotional components of eduacation. So, bad behavior, whatever that is, is not by itself cause for a grade drop; however, considering that a classroom is also a cultural space, we must strive to reinforce procedures that would lead to future success as students grow. 

#### As a teacher, not only do I feel that grading for equity is possible, but also that it should be expected. Particularly the idea that a teacher must show the students models of mastery at differnet levels in order to guide them in taking charge of their own success. I don't believe that grading should ever be done without a rubric that students understand, and to the extent possible students should be involved in designing that grading rubric so that they would have full ownership of the method used to grade their work.
