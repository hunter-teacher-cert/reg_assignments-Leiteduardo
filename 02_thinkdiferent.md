### Assignment
  * title: **think_different.md**
  * Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
    - Anything else you deem important

### 3 Different Strategies for implementing differentiation
  * kinetic
  * grouping 
  * extended time

#### kinetic
##### Being confined to a keyboard is not something that comes naturally to everyone. Some students have the need to move in order to better release the energies that, when confined, prevent them from learning at their best. So, in class I allow student to find their own comfort zone: they may need to move around or do their work standing at their computers. This strategy works particularly well for a few tall students that I have after lunch. Being active by nature, those students perfom better if they are allowed to find comfort with their bodies. In addition, I also use kinetic differentiation during presentations since some students prefer to present their work at the front of the classroom while others don't.

#### grouping
##### Depending on the type of work that is assigned, students may be grouped homogeneously or heterogeneously. 
* Heterogeneous grouping is beneficial for assignments in which one student would benefit from the help that more proficient students might provide. This type of differentiation works great at the beginning of a new unit when new topica are introduced. At that point we would want students to learn by teaching one another and growing together in their understanding. 
* Homogeneous grouping can be used when an assignement contains a rubric that focuses on process over product. Sometimes you just want to see how much the good students can achieve if they are working with peers of the same abilities
