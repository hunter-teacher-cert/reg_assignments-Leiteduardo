### Assignment
  * title: **think_different.md**
  * Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
    - Anything else you deem important

### 3 Different Strategies for implementing differentiation
  * kinetic
  * grouping 
  * extended time

#### kinetic
##### some students have the need to move in order to better release the energies that, when confined, prevent them from learning at their best. So, in class I allow student to find their own comfort zone if they need to move around or do their work standing at their computers. This strategy works particularly well for a few tall students that I have after lunch. Being active by nature, those students perfom better if they are allowed to find comfort with their bodies. In addition, I also use kinetic differentiation during presentations since some students prefer to present their work at the front of the classroom while others don't.
