### # Assignment
  * title: **goodnbad**
  * Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.
##### I have recently started teaching Python to my Intro CS class for Freshmen. We are working with the turtle library to draw shapes. My assignment was for the students to draw their flags, --either from their countries or a country that they identify with. The first phase of the project was for the students to plan their code on grid paper, where they would identify each end point in their flag as a cooordinate point. They would also need to list the commands that they would use to draw each section of the flags.
    - Why do you think it didnâ€™t go well?
##### I think that it did not go well because: first, the students prefer to code than to plan; second, my instrutions were not very clear; I should have a model for what to do, but I could not use the smart board to show them on the grid how to locate the coordinates, so they struggled a bit.
    - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
##### I would make sure that I had a clear, visible model of the task so the students could have a visual representation of the task.
  * Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.
##### Still about drawing shapes. I am working with CodeHS thanks to a recomendation from Izagma. I start a new topic by showing the short instructional video provided; then I give the students a few minutes to copy the sample code onto their Replit; finallt, I assign the task of the day, which is an application of the topic covered.
    - Why do you think it went so well?
#### It goes well because the students are presented with clear explanations of the topics, then immediatelly apply what they learned. In addition, as the students copy the code that was presented, I make sure that it is working for them, i.e. error free, before they can move on.
  * These examples could come from normal classes, presentations, tutoring sessions, helping a friend, as long as you were teaching, it can count.
